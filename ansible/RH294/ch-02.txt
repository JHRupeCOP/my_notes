Ansible inventory

basic static inventory - list of host in a INI-syle file, one host/IP per line
ex: 
servera.example.com
serverb.example.com
192.1.2.42
-

host group: means of organizing hosts into groups. The group name is encased in sqaure
brackets [] followed by a list of host names
ex:
[webservers]
servera.example.com
serverb.example.com

[db-servers]
serverc.example.com
serverd.example.com
-

hosts can belong to multiple groups
two built-in host groups: 
all - contains every host explicitly listed
ungrouped - contains every host that is not a member of any other group


Nested groups
you can have a group of groups by creating a group name with the :children suffix
ex:
[usa]
servera.example.com

[canada]
serverb.example.com

[north-america:children]
usa
canada

The members of the usa and canada groups also belong to north-america group

Specify host ranges  [start:end]
Can be alpha or numeric 
ex.
server[a:d].example.com    --> includes servera, serverb, serverc, and serverd

server[01:20].example.com  --> includes servers01 - 20, but not server1, etc
